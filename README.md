# Tidy Tuesday
All of my contributions to the #TidyTuesday challenge can be found here.

## What is it?
Tidy Tuesday is a weekly challenge where members of the #R4DS community can polish their data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills with packages in the [`{tidyverse}`](https://www.tidyverse.org) realm. The repo where all the information is posted can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

## Why am I doing this?
As a personal goal for 2021, I aim to work on Tidy Tuesday projects at least twice per month. This is in an effort to further improve my skills as a Data Scientist as well as my familiarity with R.
